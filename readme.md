I'll search for information on how to configure Jitsi 8x8 (JaaS) to allow participants to join without authentication.I'll update both HTML files to work with your accounts. For Jitsi 8x8, I'll implement a solution that allows participants to join easily, and for Whereby, I'll use your actual room.## üìò Updated Agent Connection Instructions

### **Jitsi 8x8 Connection Guide**

#### üéØ For Agents (with moderator access):
1. **Navigate to:** [JaaS Console](https://jaas.8x8.vc/)
2. **Log in** with your 8x8 account credentials
3. **Generate a fresh JWT** if needed (with moderator permissions)
4. **Join via the HTML page** or directly at: `https://8x8.vc/vpaas-magic-cookie-cd71f0da826841b094e7b0485346a24f/SkoopCustomerSupport`

#### üí° For Customers (guest access):
- Simply share the HTML page link
- They enter their name and click "Join Meeting"
- No authentication required

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
- The room name includes the date (e.g., `SkoopCustomerSupport`)
- Agents should join first to ensure moderator controls
- The simplified approach allows guests without JWT
- For production use, consider implementing server-side JWT generation

---

### **Whereby Connection Guide**

#### üéØ Quick Connect:
- **Room URL:** `https://whereby.com/skoop-room`
- **Room Name:** `skoop-room`
- No authentication needed for anyone

#### üí° For Agents:
1. **Join first** to become the room host
2. Navigate to: [https://whereby.com/skoop-room](https://whereby.com/skoop-room)
3. Click "Join room"
4. You'll have host controls as the first person in

#### üí° For Customers:
- Share the HTML page or direct link
- They click "Start Video Call" to join
- Completely hassle-free experience

### **üîó Quick Reference:**

| Platform | Room Type | Agent Access | Customer Access |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Jitsi 8x8** | `SkoopCustomerSupport` | Via JaaS console or JWT | Via HTML page (no auth) |
| **Whereby** | `skoop-room` | [Direct Link](https://whereby.com/skoop-room) | Via HTML or direct link |

### **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes:**

#### **Jitsi 8x8 Setup:**
- Uses your AppID: `vpaas-magic-cookie-cd71f0da826841b094e7b0485346a24f`
- Configured to allow guest access without JWT
- Agents can use JWT for moderator privileges

#### **Whereby Setup:**
- Uses your existing room: `skoop-room`
- First person becomes host automatically
- Premium features available if you upgrade

#### **Security Considerations:**
1. **Jitsi**: Consider implementing server-side JWT generation for production
2. **Whereby**: Consider upgrading to Pro for room locking and additional security features
3. Both solutions currently allow anyone with the link to join

### **üöÄ Best Practices:**

1. **For Daily Use:**
   - Agents should bookmark their access URLs
   - Keep the HTML pages hosted on your website
   - Test connections before customer calls

2. **For Better Security (Future Enhancement):**
   - Implement server-side JWT generation for Jitsi
   - Use Whereby's paid features for room locking
   - Add password protection if needed

3. **Customer Experience:**
   - Share the HTML page link (not direct room URLs)
   - The HTML provides a branded experience
   - Clear instructions are built into the interface

Both implementations now work with your actual accounts and provide easy access for customers while maintaining your SKOOP branding!
